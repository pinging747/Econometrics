We can plot the model accuracy vs cutoff level to find the optimum
cutoff.

##make a prediction for the test data

fitted.results <- predict(LR,newdata=test,type='response')

##select a sequence of cutoffs and the consequenct predictions
##then save accuracy of each prediction in a vector

cutoffs <- seq(0.1,0.9,0.1)
accuracy <- NULL
for (i in seq(along = cutoffs)){
  prediction <- ifelse(fitted.results >= cutoffs[i], 1, 0) #Predicting for cut-off
  accuracy <- c(accuracy,length(which(test$Churn ==prediction))/length(prediction)*100)
}

#make the plot

plot(cutoffs, accuracy, pch =19,type='b',col= "steelblue",
     main ="Logistic Regression", xlab="Cutoff Level", ylab = "Accuracy %")
